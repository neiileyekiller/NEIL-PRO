<p>July began with the auspicious Pandharpur Wari. Pandharpur Wari is an embodiment of the human spirit at its purest. It is an 
opportunity for all those who seek spiritual awakening to bask in the radiance of this unparalleled experience. It is a celebration of 
life where the richness of humanity unfolds, unencumbered by the trappings of the material world. More than a physical journey, 
it is a spiritual odyssey that touches the depths of oneâ€™s soul. It is a testament to the power of devotion and the potential of 
collective faith</p>
